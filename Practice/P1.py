# Sure, here's a logical programming question that involves building a program to solve a specific problem:

# **Problem: Fibonacci Series Modification**

# You are given a list of integers, and you need to write a Python program to modify this list by replacing each element with the sum of the previous two elements in the Fibonacci sequence. Assume that the first two elements of the list are already in Fibonacci sequence order.

# For example, if the input list is `[1, 1, 5, 9, 14]`, the program should modify the list to `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5]` because 2 is the sum of 1 and 1, 3 is the sum of 1 and 2, and so on.

# Write a Python function called `modify_fibonacci` that takes a list of integers as input and modifies the list according to the Fibonacci sequence logic described above. The function should return the modified list.

# Test your function with the following inputs:
# 1. `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5]` (Expected output: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5]`)
# 2. `[3, 5, 8, 13, 21]` (Expected output: `[3, 5, 8, 13, 21]`)
# 3. `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (Expected output: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`)
# 4. `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]` (Expected output: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]`)

# Your solution should handle lists of any length and maintain the first two elements unchanged.

# Let me know if you'd like any further clarifications or if you'd like to see a possible solution!
